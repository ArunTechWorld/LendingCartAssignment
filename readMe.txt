I spent 2 Hours 30 minutes to implement this Application in mobile view.

I have used IONIC 2 frame work to build this Application.

Features implemented:
    1.User can add new comments.
    2.User can modify existing comment.
    3.User can reply for existing comment.
    4.User can search comment.

Detail description:
Added basic 2 modules User and Comments. I have completed comments module(Assignment 1)
    I am storing the initial few comments in the services. application will display the predefined comments now.
     once the user enter new comment and SEND. i will be saved. user can edit reply for the comment.

I have not written test case, and not implemented the coomon reusable, that is more modular structure(due to time constraint). yet to add loader, network checks, error checks,
in all cases. needs to show hide and clear searchbar based on the user experience.
